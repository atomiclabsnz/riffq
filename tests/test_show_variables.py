"""SHOW answers riffq handles itself, without reaching the query handler.

Clients read session variables while connecting, before any user query runs, so
riffq answers a few SHOW statements directly. psqlodbc asks for the isolation
level this way as part of its connect sequence, and it spells it
``SHOW transaction_isolation`` -- one variable name -- rather than the
three-keyword ``SHOW TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL``. Both spellings must answer,
and with the same value.

The query handler here returns a sentinel, so a SHOW that was wrongly delegated
to it fails visibly instead of coincidentally looking right.
