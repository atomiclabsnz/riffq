"""Multi-statement simple-query batches run every statement, not just the first.

The PostgreSQL simple query protocol lets one Query message carry several
statements separated by semicolons, and the server runs each in turn, replying
with one result set per statement. Clients that build their own SQL depend on
it: Npgsql sends its whole startup type-loading batch that way, so a server
that stopped at the first statement could not be connected to at all.

psycopg uses the simple query protocol when a query has no parameters, so these
tests reach that path by passing none, and step through the results with
``nextset()``.
