""".NET/Npgsql tier: the fixture as seen by a from-scratch protocol client.

Npgsql does not wrap libpq and does not use pgjdbc's metadata code, so this tier
covers a third client stack independently of the ODBC and JDBC ones. It is the
strictest protocol client the suite drives: it loads its type catalogue from
pg_type when the connection opens, and GetSchema issues its own catalog SQL.

The assertions come from fixture_dataset, the same source of truth the other two
tiers use, so all three agree on what the server should report rather than each
carrying its own copy.

The harness connects with Npgsql's default settings, so simply opening the
connection exercises its startup type loading: a multi-statement batch carrying
"SELECT version();" and its pg_type, composite and enum queries. That path
covers far more of the catalog than any single assertion here, and it was
broken in two separate ways before -- see tests/integration/README.md.
