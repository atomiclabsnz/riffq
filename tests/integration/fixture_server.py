"""The riffq server the driver integration tests run against.

A DuckDB in-memory database holds the three fixture tables; riffq answers
pg_catalog / information_schema queries from teleduck's shipped
``DuckdbCatalogSource`` (the same lazy-catalog path a real teleduck deployment
uses), and this module's connection handles the data path -- ordinary SELECTs
plus the SET / SHOW / transaction-control statements the ODBC and JDBC drivers
issue during their connect handshake.

The server is launched in a child process with ``multiprocessing.Process`` and
torn down with ``riffq.testing.stop_server``; tests wait for readiness with
``wait_for_catalog`` rather than sleeping. Two things are specific to these
tests: the server version is pinned (both drivers gate behaviour on it, so
pinning makes their behaviour deterministic), and every statement the data path
receives is appended to a JSON-lines query log with whether it errored. The log
is a test artifact -- it lets a failing assertion name the exact driver query
that broke, which is otherwise very hard to see through a driver -- not a riffq
feature.
