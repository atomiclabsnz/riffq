# Verify this repository: format, lint, build, and every test including the
# end-to-end driver tiers.
#
# This is the single definition of what "verified" means here. The pre-commit
# hook calls it rather than keeping its own copy of the pipeline, so a check
# added here is a check the hook enforces, with no second list to keep in step.
#
# Nothing in it is conditional on which files changed: a docs-only edit rebuilds
# the extension and runs the ODBC, JDBC, .NET and CloudBeaver tiers exactly as a
# rewrite of the wire protocol would. Run it by hand any time; it only reads the
# tree, never rewrites it (`cargo fmt --check` reports, the hook is what
# reformats).
#
# Expect roughly half an hour: the pgjdbc matrix alone runs the JDBC tier once
# per pinned driver release. Exits non-zero on the first failure.

# LD_LIBRARY_PATH before python starts, which is the only moment the dynamic
